## Web Security Layers

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- **SSL/TLS Protocols**: Ensure encrypted communication.
- **Certificates**: Authenticate websites and encrypt data.

### Application Layer Security
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Filter and monitor HTTP traffic.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

### Network Layer Security
- **Firewalls**: Control network traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor for suspicious activity.

### Endpoint Security
- **Antivirus and Anti-malware**: Protect devices from malicious software.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Monitor and respond to threats.

## Conclusion
Implementing these security layers ensures comprehensive protection against a wide range of cyber threats, building trust with users and complying with regulatory requirements.
