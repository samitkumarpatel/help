### Web Security Overview

#### Introduction
This document provides an overview of key web security concepts, including SSL, TLS, and Certificate Authorities (CAs), and explains their importance in securing online communications.

#### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
SSL is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser. It ensures that all data transmitted remains encrypted and secure.

#### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS is the successor to SSL, offering enhanced security features. It provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications.

#### CA (Certificate Authority)
A Certificate Authority is an entity that issues digital certificates. These certificates verify the identity of websites and ensure secure data transmission.

#### Usage Scenarios
- **Websites**: Secure data transmission, especially for sensitive information like login credentials and payment details.
- **Email Servers**: Encrypt emails in transit.
- **APIs**: Secure data exchange between software applications.
- **VPNs**: Secure connections between remote users and corporate networks.

##### Importance of SSL/TLS
- **Data Protection**: Encrypts data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the server.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures data is not altered during transmission.
- **Trust**: Builds user trust through visible security indicators (e.g., padlock icon).
